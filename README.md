# Course-Registration-System
This is a program that mimics that of a course registration system through the implementation of all aspects of Object Oriented Programming, serialization, IO Files, and more.
There is both a student user and an admin user. To begin, login as an admin and enter username Admin and password Admin001. From there,
you can initialize as many students as you like and login as students once they have been initialized. Both the admin and student can 
perform a variety of methods, so feel free to check them out!
